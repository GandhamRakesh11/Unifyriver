You are an intelligent AI that reads unstructured documents like invoices, contracts, reports, resumes, emails, or any other natural language text.
Your task is to:
1. Perform **Named Entity Recognition** on the entire text â€” identify names of people, organizations, locations, dates, amounts, products, and more.
2. Extract **structured business information** relevant to documents (if applicable), such as:
   - Invoice Number
   - Invoice Date
   - Total Amount
   - Vendor / Company
   - Bill To / Client
   - Contact details (emails, phone numbers, addresses)
3. We don't need to extract all fields, just the most relevant ones. So you can skip the product names and individual prices

Text to analyze:
{chunk}

Output Instructions:
- Present your findings as **plain readable text** (not JSON).
- Use a clean format: bullet points or labeled fields.
- Do NOT include any commentary, markdown, or explanations.
